//! [Problem 30 (Digit fifth powers)](https://projecteuler.net/problem=30)
//!
//! # Problem statement
//!
//! Surprisingly there are only three numbers that can be written as the sum of fourth powers of
//! their digits:
//!
//! 1634 = 1<sup>4</sup> + 6<sup>4</sup> + 3<sup>4</sup> + 4<sup>4</sup>
//!
//! 8208 = 8<sup>4</sup> + 2<sup>4</sup> + 0<sup>4</sup> + 8<sup>4</sup>
//!
//! 9474 = 9<sup>4</sup> + 4<sup>4</sup> + 7<sup>4</sup> + 4<sup>4</sup>
//!
//! As 1 = 1<sup>4</sup> is not a sum it is not included.
//!
//! The sum of these numbers is 1634 + 8208 + 9474 = 19316. Find the sum of all the numbers that
//! can be written as the sum of fifth powers of their digits.
//!
//! # Solution detail
//!
//! We can find the solutions to this problem using a backtracking-style algorithm, building up
//! the solutions from left-to-right one digit at a time. Note that since 7 Ã— 9<sup>5</sup> has
//! only 6 digits, there cannot be any solutions with more than 6 digits. This means that our
//! search tree only has depth 6.
//!
//! We can also prune the search tree before reaching the bottom by calculating the maximum and
//! minimum values that can be obtained by by the sum of fifth powers after extending the number
//! to length 6, and seeing if the number itself can ever fall within that range.
//!
//! For example, no matter what three digits we add to the end of 211, the sum of fifth powers can
//! never be larger than 2<sup>5</sup> + 1 + 1 + 9<sup>5</sup> + 9<sup>5</sup> + 9<sup>5</sup>,
//! which is equal to 177181. On the other hand, the number itself after adding three digits will
//! always be at least 211000, so there cannot possibly be a solution.
//!
//! Finally, remember to subtract 1 at the end, since it is not counted as a solution.
