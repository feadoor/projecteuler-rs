//! [Problem 1 (Multiples of 3 and 5)](https://projecteuler.net/problem=1)
//!
//! # Problem statement
//!
//! If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9.
//! The sum of these multiples is 23.
//!
//! Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
//!
//! # Solution detail
//!
//! Using the
//! [inclusion-exclusion principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclusionâ€“exclusion_principle),
//! we can calculate the required sum as `s_3 + s_5 - s_15`, where:
//!
//! `s_3` is the sum of the multiples of 3 below 1000.
//!
//! `s_5` is the sum of the multiples of 5 below 1000.
//!
//! `s_15` is the sum of the multiples of 15 (i.e. divisible by both 3 and 5) below 1000.
//!
//! Each of these quantites is the sum of an
//! [arithmetic progression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_progression) and can be
//! calculated by the usual formula.
