//! [Problem 4 (Largest palindrome product)](https://projecteuler.net/problem=4)
//!
//! # Problem statement
//!
//! A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of
//! two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
//!
//! Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
//!
//! # Solution detail
//!
//! Simply form all possible products of 2-digit numbers, and keep track of the largest one which
//! is a palindrome. As a simple optimisation, we can consider the larger products first, and
//! break out of loops early when all future products will be smaller than the current best.
