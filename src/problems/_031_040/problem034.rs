//! [Problem 34 (Digit factorials)](https://projecteuler.net/problem=34)
//!
//! # Problem statement
//!
//! 145 is a curious number, as 1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145.
//!
//! Find the sum of all numbers which are equal to the sum of the factorial of their digits.
//!
//! Note: as 1! = 1 and 2! = 2 are not sums they are not included.
//!
//! # Solution detail
//!
//! We can find the solutions to this problem using a backtracking-style algorithm, building up
//! the solutions from left-to-right one digit at a time. Note that since 8 Ã— 9! has
//! only 7 digits, there cannot be any solutions with more than 7 digits. This means that our
//! search tree only has depth 7.
//!
//! We can also prune the search tree before reaching the bottom by calculating the maximum and
//! minimum values that can be obtained by by the sum of factorials after extending the number
//! to length 7, and seeing if the number itself can ever fall within that range.
//!
//! For example, no matter what three digits we add to the end of 211, the sum of factorials can
//! never be larger than 2! + 1! + 1! + 9! + 9! + 9! + 9!, which is equal to 1451524. On the
//! other hand, the number itself after adding four digits will always be at least 2110000, so
//! there cannot possibly be a solution.
//!
//! Finally, remember to subtract 3 at the end, since 1 and 2 are not counted as solutions.
