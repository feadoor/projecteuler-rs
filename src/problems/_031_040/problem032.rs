//! [Problem 32 (Pandigital products)](https://projecteuler.net/problem=32)
//!
//! # Problem statement
//!
//! We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the digits 1 to n
//! exactly once; for example, the 5-digit number, 15234, is 1 through 5 pandigital.
//!
//! The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, 39 Ã— 186 = 7254, containing multiplicand,
//! multiplier, and product is 1 through 9 pandigital.
//!
//! Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity can be written as
//! a 1 through 9 pandigital.
//!
//! HINT: Some products can be obtained in more than one way so be sure to only include it once in
//! your sum.
//!
//! # Solution detail
//!
//! Note that for `a * b = c` to be a 1-9 pandigital product, where `a < b`, there are only two
//! possibilities for the lengths of the operands:
//!
//! <ul>
//! <li>(2 digits) * (3 digits) = (4 digits)</li>
//! <li>(1 digit)  * (4 digits) = (4 digits)</li>
//! </ul>
//!
//! These two cases are small enough that we can just iterate over all choices for `a, b` and
//! check if the resulting product is pandigital.
