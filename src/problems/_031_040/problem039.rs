//! [Problem 39 (Integer right triangles)](https://projecteuler.net/problem=39)
//!
//! # Problem statement
//!
//! If p is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with integral length sides, {a,b,c}, there are
//! exactly three solutions for p = 120:
//!
//! {20,48,52}, {24,45,51}, {30,40,50}
//!
//! For which value of p â‰¤ 1000, is the number of solutions maximised?
//!
//! # Solution detail
//!
//! Simply iterate over all Pythagorean triples with perimeter at most 1000. Keep track, for each
//! possible perimeter, how many triangles with that perimeter have been found, and then just
//! find the perimeter which has the most.
//!
//! To iterate over Pythagorean triples, find the primitive triples using the tree structure
//! described [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_of_primitive_Pythagorean_triples), and
//! multiply up to non-primitive triples as well.
