//! [Problem 126 (Cuboid layers)](https://projecteuler.net/problem=126)
//!
//! # Solution detail
//!
//! It's slightly fiddly to calculate the number of cubes in each layer, but it can be done! If the
//! side lengths of the cuboid are `a`, `b` and `c` then the number of cubes in a single layer is:
//!
//! `2(ab + bc + ca) + 4(n-1)(a + b + c - 1) + 4(n-1)Â²`
//!
//! Then, brute force is our best friend. Assuming that the answer is below a particular limit,
//! then just iterate over all cuboids, and over all layers, storing the number of times each
//! number of cubes has been seen, for each number of cubes up to the limit. If any number of cubes
//! has been used the right number of times, then that's the answer. Otherwise, increase the limit
//! a little (e.g. double it) and start again.
