//! [Problem 30 (Digit fifth powers)](https://projecteuler.net/problem=30)
//!
//! # Solution detail
//!
//! We can find the solutions to this problem using a backtracking-style algorithm, building up
//! the solutions from left-to-right one digit at a time. Note that since 7 Ã— 9<sup>5</sup> has
//! only 6 digits, there cannot be any solutions with more than 6 digits. This means that our
//! search tree only has depth 6.
//!
//! We can also prune the search tree before reaching the bottom by calculating the maximum and
//! minimum values that can be obtained by by the sum of fifth powers after extending the number
//! to length 6, and seeing if the number itself can ever fall within that range.
//!
//! For example, no matter what three digits we add to the end of 211, the sum of fifth powers can
//! never be larger than 2<sup>5</sup> + 1 + 1 + 9<sup>5</sup> + 9<sup>5</sup> + 9<sup>5</sup>,
//! which is equal to 177181. On the other hand, the number itself after adding three digits will
//! always be at least 211000, so there cannot possibly be a solution.
//!
//! Finally, remember to subtract 1 at the end, since it is not counted as a solution.
